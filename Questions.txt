Problem 1 
Write a program named FromKeyboad.java that read three number from md argument list, then calculate and display those that are divisible by 23.

Problem 2 
Write a program named FromArgumentList.java that accepts 4 numbers from the command argument list, then counts and displays how many of then are even numbers.

Problem 3 
Write a program named CountingNumbers.java that accepts three numbers N, M, and B from Cmd argument list, then count and print how many numbers between [N, M] are divisible by B. Assume N < M. 
For example, if you enter 3 9 5 then your program should output:
For all numbers between [3, 9],  there is 1 number divisible by 5.
 
Problem 4 
The Harris-Benedict equation estimates the number of calories your body needs to maintain your weight if you do no exercise. This is called your basal metabolic rate, or BMR.

The calories needed fro a woman to maintain her weight is:
BMR=655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)

The calories needed for a man to maintain his weight is:
BRM = 66 + (6.3 x weight in pounds) + ( 12.9 x height in inches)  - (6.8 x age in years)

A typical chocolate bar contains around 230 calories. Write a program named Calories.java that accepts (from Cmd argument list) gender(Female or Male) followed by 3 numbers indicating weight in pounds, height in inches, and age in years. The program should output the number of chocolate bars that should be consumed to main one's weight.

Problem 5 
Write a program named Order.java that accepts four numbers from the command argument list, then display the four numbers in increasing order.
